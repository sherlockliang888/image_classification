# image_classification

### Project requirement
Put your results in a report. Report need to include:
*	Problem statement, 
*	Database (how you have created it, or where did you get it, 
* The CNN model and 
*	Results, the model performance (test, valid), the loss, predictionsâ€¦
Use confusion matrices
                                                     
In your results please comment and discuss the following:
*	Evaluate the model, how?
*	How your model change when you have a deeper model or change number of nodes (try optimizing your model architecture)?
*	The best performance (i.e what are the model hyperparameters or structure that you will get the best performance, or most optimized model)

Important Note:
You have to make sure to perform your training in 3 steps:
*	Only train your data with 200 images and evaluate model
*	Use the same original images in part I) and augment 300 more images from them. Now train your model on the 500 set of images
*	Train your model with 1000 original images (or total number of images if your dataset has less)
*	Augment 1000 more images and train your data in the 2000 (1000 original plus 1000 augment)
